Inspired by the concept of antipatterns in computer programming.

### Fast Roads
Antipattern: Wide curving city roads with traffic lights where cars consistently speed

Detail:
* Seems to happen at curving and roundabout-like junctions.
* Cars *feel* like driving fast to very fast
* It's dangerous / unpleasant for pedestrians
* I doubt there's not much system benefit
    * ~bottlenecks determine travel time even if you go fast between them

Examples:
* London
    * Hammersmith (near St. Paul's church)
    * Hyde Park Corner (east of Wellington Arch)
    * Vauxhall (turning left onto Vauxhall bridge)

Antidote
* Make drivers *feel* comfortable driving more slowly
* TBC how. Something involving narrower lanes and tactile feedback perhaps


### Dublin Transport (as of 2022)
Antipattern: Dublin lacks a metro system

Detail:
* Dublin lacks a metro system comparable to London, Paris, Berlin, Lisbon, Barcelona, Lyon, Munich ...
* The DART work relatively well for those who live nearby.
* There were trams in the early 1900s. The current Luas tram covers some of the same route.
* But the city is car focused and people spend too much time in traffic during peak hours
* It contrasts with London's tube network everything *feels* within reach

Antidote:
* Metro system
* Trams might also work although I'm not sure how good the existing Luas is

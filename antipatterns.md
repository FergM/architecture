### Ageing
The problem where a building looks good initially but bad after it reaches 10+ years.

I'm focusing on the design side although maintenance is also a factor.

Rule of Thumb:
* New builds should be evaluated considering how they will age
* Beware of unrealistic renderings that don't account for future ageing
* You can find other projects with similar designs for a guide on how elements will age

Examples:
* Wooden slats on the outside of a building
* Flat surfaces that build up dirt / run-off streaks (mouldings and ledges can help here)

### Over Insulation
The problem where new build apartments are so insulated that they need air conditioning in summer.

Observed in Dublin and London. Typically the apartment gets an *A* grade energy rating but ironically the occupant ends up installing an air conditioner to handle the heat.

### Fast Roads
Antipattern: Wide curving city roads with traffic lights where cars consistently speed

Antidote
* Make drivers *feel* comfortable driving more slowly
* TBC how. Something involving narrower lanes and tactile feedback perhaps

Examples:
* London
    * Hammersmith (near St. Paul's church)
    * Hyde Park Corner (east of Wellington Arch)
    * Vauxhall (turning left onto Vauxhall bridge)

Detail:
* Seems to happen at curving and roundabout-like junctions.
* Cars *feel* like driving fast to very fast
* It's dangerous / unpleasant for pedestrians
* I doubt there's not much system benefit
    * ~bottlenecks determine travel time even if you go fast between them

### Dublin Transport 
Antipattern: Dublin lacks a metro system. Car/bus dominates and workers spend much time in traffic.

Rule of Thumb:
* Do people describe areas based on the tube stop?
* Do tourists visualise the city according to a tube map?
* Does car/bus dominate over train/rail for commuting?
* Do travel times get 10x worse during rush hour?

Antidote:
* Metro system
* Trams might also work although I'm not sure how good the existing Luas is

Detail:
* Dublin lacks a metro system comparable to London, Paris, Berlin, Lisbon, Barcelona, Lyon, Munich
* Even Geneva and Lausanne with under 200,000 population have worthwhile metro/tram systems
* The DART work relatively well for those who live nearby.
* There were trams in the early 1900s. The current Luas tram covers some of the same route.
* But the city is car focused and people spend too much time in traffic during peak hours
* Workers get caught in traffic going to work and dropping kids to school
* It contrasts with London's tube network everything *feels* within reach
* Bangalore is perhaps similar (heavy traffic and slow to get around the city)
    * However taxis are much cheaper relative to wealth
    * Areas of the city are somewhat self contained with amenities (less need to travel)

### Wind From Tall Buildings
Antipattern:
* Tall buildings create tunnels of unpleasant wind for pedestriance

Antidote:
* Windy streets (pun intended!)
* Mid-rise gentle density
* Wind modelling

Examples:
* 22 Bishopsgate, City of London

Detail:
* It doesn't have to be tall buildings
    * Mid-rise can create undesired tunnelling effects
    * I've seen people struggle to walk south along One Dockland Centra, Guild Street Dublin
    * It was a weathery day but the building design accentuated things in this location

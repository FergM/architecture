# Rolling Rough Notes
Housing Density
* Delhi DDA Case Study
   * Low, medium and high *Income Group* conventions (LIG, MIG, HIG)
   * Layout with parks
   * Would HIG inspired design density work in Dublin?
* Vienna
   * Overlay against London/Dublin density
   * I'm guessing Vienna is the most compact (adjusting for population)
* Growing vs. Shrinking Cities
   * Below Peak Population:
       * Potentially easier to manage demand
       * Vienna - lots of quality social housing
       * Chicago - more *free market*
   * Growing
       * Dublin / London

Interior Design
* All my notes so far are focused on streets and external appearance
* Offices
   * *Some beautiful buildings have bland interiors.*
   * In London traditional buildings often have non-traditional interiors
   * Often
      * utilitarian / minimalist
      * have lots of flat/white surfaces feel
      * have little ornamentation or hand crafted furniture
   * What if we start fitting offices with traditional designs?
      * I think office workers might really like working in a traditional office
      * Or at least one with more ornamentation/handwork/wood
      * But it's not on the radar of office managers.
      * Untapped potential?
* Ceilings
   * Most new ceilings have no ornamentation or plasterwork
   * When they do it's often cube and circle inspired extrusions rather than nature inspired multi-scale patterns
   * Again there's probably hidden demand here for beautiful ceilings
   * In the age of video calls an ornamented ceiling can look quite nice as a background
   * by plain walls and a flat ceiling can look very bare


Cars
* Parking
    * What are good approaches
    * **Beautiful Multi-storey car parks**?
        * Inspired by horse "garage" conversions
        * *Beautiful car park* doesn't have to be an oxymoron
        * See beautiful brick garages around Shat Thames in London
        * Put them in more shaded streets so that occupied buildings get priority for sunlight
    * Avoid
        * Parking in squares which would make great public spaces
        * Devoting more land to parking than buildings and public space (Some cities in the USA)
    * Underground? 
        * Try to keep street level nice so it's not just ventilation fins.
    * Discourage Cars?
        * London congestion and emissions charges
        * Prioritise metros, bicycles, busses, walkable urban areas
        * Maintain accessibility for disabled and elderly
* see fast road notes in antipatterns.md

Democracy
* Democratic selection of public buildings would likely increase the amount of traditional architecture
* These days public commissions are rarely traditional, however the public does like traditional buildings and much more so than most architectural experts and the prevailing architectural establishment.
* In fact traditional architects largely work on private projects, homes and restorations. New public buildings are difficult to win because these tend to go to the architectural establishment which is modernism dominated.

Education
* Few architecture schools teach traditional elements these days
* This creates a skills shortage, even if traditional buildings are desired few people are trained to deliver them
* Keep in mind that it's hard to think of an ugly building built before WW1 so we must have been doing something very right
* The Institute of Traditional Architecture amongst others are working to create summer schools and convince architecture deans to include traditional content on curricula

Art Deco
* You can **just look at a building and tell that it is art deco and guess it was built between the two world wars.**
* Embraces ornamentation although often more simple stonework than classical buildings  
* Often includes large characteristic statues. Upright with straight lines and not postured and muscular like Michaelangelo's David 
* Examples
    * Christ the Redeemer Statue, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (statue)
    * Hammersmith Apollo, London (theatre)
    * The Great Gatsby (movie)
    * Adelaide House, by London Bridge
    * St. Olaf House, London Bridge Hospital
    * 52 Gracechurch St., City of London

Gaudi / Catalan Modernism
* Embraces ornamentation, in contrast with modernism

Public Buildings
* Democratic selection
* Counterproposals

* Show multiple options (including a traditional one) before deciding
* Show existing very similar examples (iterate small improvements) too risky to screw up the whole area on people...
* Beware of Computer Generated images vs. reality

Beauty vs Novelty

traditional.md
* Contemporary
    * Schools (Northern Europe, Notre Dame)
    * Architects (Quinlan Terry Architects UK, Sebastian Treese Germany)
* Historic
    * Vitruvius - Ancient Rome
* **Insightful Question**
    * *Can you think of an ugly building built before WW1?* - Joseph Jutras
    * It's hard to find one. This shows that we must have been doing something right back then
    * My conclusion is we should reintroduce the traditional teaching which has been dropped from modern architecture curricula 

Overoptimised Design
* City Hall, More London Riverside
    * TBC what will happen now that the Mayor of London has moved out
    * There's something to be said for buildings that can "grow" and shift as needs change
    * Many brick buildings in london show signs of multi-generational growth

Governance
* Planning
    * approval by default if fits within certain guidelines
    * accidentally banning more of what's good
    * regulating against existing good builds
    * Planning rules sometimes prohibit new builds which would resemble the most popular historic structures
        * [@Cobylefko](https://twitter.com/Cobylefko/status/1509906097741647886)
        * ```
            A great irony of our cities is that we love our significant historic structures so much that 
            we create all kinds of rules to make sure places like them will never be built again.
          ```
* Affordable Housing
    * We shouldn't accept sub-par affordable housing just to make it cheap
    * It's important to keep the longer term ageing of developments in mind
    * The best developments arguably increase in value with age
        * [@Cobylefko](https://twitter.com/Cobylefko/status/1510462066829758471)
        * ```
            A lot of affordable housing unfortunately suffers from feeling less than market rate in important ways, 
            whether through design, planning, structural quality, or other factors.

The white shad thames building...

Rules of Thumb
* Clearly defined entrance location
* Flat Roofs
* Ornamentation
* Looks the same upside down

Anti-Patterns
* Selfish view buildings
    * Buildings that have a great view but detract from the view for neighbours
    * The best thing about X is that it's the only place from which you can't see X.
    * Examples:
        * Blueprint Café, Butlers Wharf, 28 Shad Thames, London
        * Vogans Mill Tower, Mill Street, London
        * Paris: Tour Montparnasse
        * Lyon: Tour Part-Dieu
* Canary Wharf vs. City of London
    * What is it that makes people prefer city
    * More bars? Nicer Bars and streets?

Patterns.md
* city walls
    * scarcity is the mother of invention
    * Humans handle scarcity better than abundance
* london traffic discouragement
* windy streets
    * i.e. streets that wind and curve, often the opposite of streets with lots of wind gusts
    * Adam's court, Austin Friars, Throgmorton Ave. 
    * contrast with canary wharf?
    * Increases the mental density? Places feel more diverse.

Recent Traditional Buildings:

* Swaminarayan Akshardham (Delhi) - [Consecrated 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaminarayan_Akshardham_(Delhi))

Houses that look like houses:
* Nowadays houses don't always look like houses
* However often when the objective is to look good, traditional house designs are still chosen.
* For example:
    * Films
    * Theme Parks
    * Toys
    * Advertisements

### Prizes

The most famous Architecture prize is probably the Pritzker Prize. One critique of Architecture Prizes is that they encourage design to impress Peers and Judges instead of users and locals. The Pritzker Prize for example, focuses on a narrow range of styles. It rewards surprising modernist buildings and and ignores beautiful contemporary traditional buildings. I found it intersting to walk through the [Laureates list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_Architecture_Prize#Laureates); there's a real contrast between the modernist buildings winning prizes and the ceremony locations which are invariably in traditional style buildings!

Anyhow, the [Driehaus Architecture Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driehaus_Architecture_Prize) recognises contemporary traditional and classical architecture. If that  interests you it's nice to look through the portfolios of past winners and see some recent buildings that are in a traditional style.

# Rolling Rough Notes

* Show multiple options (including a traditional one) before deciding
* Show existing very similar examples (iterate small improvements) too risky to screw up the whole area on people...
* Beware of Computer Generated images vs. reality

Beauty vs Novelty

traditional.md
* Contemporary
    * Schools (Northern Europe, Notre Dame)
    * Architects (Quinlan Terry Architects UK, Sebastian Treese Germany)
* Historic
    * Vitruvius - Ancient Rome

Overoptimised Design
* City Hall, More London Riverside
    * TBC what will happen now that the Mayor of London has moved out
    * There's something to be said for buildings that can "grow" and shift as needs change
    * Many brick buildings in london show signs of multi-generational growth

Governance
* Planning
    * approval by default if fits within certain guidelines
    * accidentally banning more of what's good
* Democracy, Representatives
* Management Committees
* London management fees
* Central **Paris**, **Berlin**, Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, Brussels, Munich, Lyon

The white shad thames building...

Rules of Thumb
* Clearly defined entrance location
* Flat Roofs
* Ornamentation
* Looks the same upside down

Anti-Patterns
* Selfish view buildings
    * Buildings that have a great view but detract from the view for neighbours
    * The best thing about X is that it's the only place from which you can't see X.
    * Examples:
        * Blueprint Café, Butlers Wharf, 28 Shad Thames, London
        * Vogans Mill Tower, Mill Street, London
        * Paris: Tour Montparnasse
        * Lyon: Tour Part-Dieu
* Canary Wharf vs. City of London
    * What is it that makes people prefer city
    * More bars? Nicer Bars and streets?

Patterns.md
* city walls
    * scarcity is the mother of invention
    * Humans handle scarcity better than abundance
* london traffic discouragement
* windy streets
    * Adam's court, Austin Friars, Throgmorton Ave. 
    * contrast with canary wharf?

Recent Traditional Buildings:

Houses that look like houses:
* Nowadays houses don't always look like houses
* However often when the objective is to look good, traditional house designs are still chosen.
* For example:
    * Films
    * Theme Parks
    * Toys
    * Advertisements

Buildings that grow:
* Broad Street Station (Philadelphia): [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Street_Station_(Philadelphia))

### Prizes

The most famous Architecture prize is probably the Pritzker Prize. One critique of Architecture Prizes is that they encourage design to impress Peers and Judges instead of users and locals. The Pritzker Prize for example, focuses on a narrow range of styles. It rewards surprising modernist buildings and and ignores beautiful contemporary traditional buildings. I found it intersting to walk through the [Laureates list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_Architecture_Prize#Laureates); there's a real contrast between the modernist buildings winning prizes and the ceremony locations which are invariably in traditional style buildings!

Anyhow, the [Driehaus Architecture Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driehaus_Architecture_Prize) recognises contemporary traditional and classical architecture. If that  interests you it's nice to look through the portfolios of past winners and see some recent buildings that are in a traditional style.

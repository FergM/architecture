## Ornamentation
In particular, multi-scale fractal ornamentation.

### Interesting Examples
Vienna Ornamentation
* Central Vienna has lots of ornamentation.
* Further out by Enkplatz for example there is much little ornamentation. It **looks like buildings used to have it but it was removed**.
* To check: Is there a relationship between neighbourhood wealth and ornamentation? Enkplatz seems poorer than Lindengasse / Neubau for example.

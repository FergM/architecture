# Modern Architecture
I mean this in the broad sense of Modern vs. Traditional.

### Twitter Memes
See [*Architects Against Humanity*](https://twitter.com/arch_crimes) on twitter: 
* The general pattern of tweets is "look at these pretty old traditional buildings then look at this ugly modern building"

### Best Modern
Some of my favourite modern architecture:

##### London
* Millenium Bridge
   * Pedestrian bridge
* The Gurkin, City of London
   * It's a landmark and people like it, hard to argue with that.
* V&A Museum Courtyard
   * This is actually surrounded by traditional buildings
   * But the courtyard garden is modernist
   * It's a lovely place to relax with a central paddling pond that is popular with kids
   * Aside: Contrast this with the Natural History Museum's oval space for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial
* The Walkie Talkie
* London Eye
   * The modern Landmark comparable Tower Bridge in its iconicness

##### Europe

* University Library

### Today's Architecture
The State of Architecture today (roughwork):
* Architecture schools
    * No longer teach key elements of traditional architecture
    * It's hard to find traditional architects
* Most firms struggle to do traditional designs
    * They're unfamiliar with the classical orders and botch them
    * They therefore promote modern designs
    * Some generalise botched examples to derogate traditionalism as "pastiche"  
    * Examples
      * 15 Finsbury Circus, London
      * 22-25 Finsbury Square, London
* Public Preference
    * Often doesn't have enough say
    * I think the public likes traditional architecture more than most architects do
* Cost Reduction
    * Sometimes cost and profit pressures sacrifice long-term builds for short term savings
    * Think: Flat Roofs, Falling Pannelling, Absence of Ornamentation, Streaky Stains as a building ages
* Industrial Production
    * Has turned buildings from a craft into an assembly
    * Is related to why *Modernism* rejects ornamentation
    * Explains WWI/WWII as a watershed moment for architecture
* Unwelcoming for Pedestrians
    * Not human scaled
        * Looks better from far away
        * Monster scaled cylindrical pillars
        * Ground level consists of air vents
        * **Generally even the best modern buildings struggle to feel warm to pedestrians on the outside**
        * Pedestrians beside the building just see bland surfaces
        * Contrast with multi-scale traditional ornamentation which is warm and welcoming for pedestrians
    * Ambiguous Entrance Location
        * For traditional designs the entrance *portal* is usually visually clear
        * For modern buildings it's usually less obvious where the entrance is
        * Signage is often needed to find the entrance
    * Rough Examples
        * Gurkin/Shard/Walkie Talkie base vs. Bank of England/St. Paul's Cathedral/Finsbury Circus
        * Finsbury Circus vs. Broadgate Circle (Both good on a sunny day with people around)
        * Leadenhall Market vs. Bloomberg Arcade (BBG is good but I think Leadenhall is even better)

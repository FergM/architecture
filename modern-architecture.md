# Modern Architecture
I mean this in the broad sense of Modern vs. Traditional.

### Twitter Memes

* The general pattern is "look at these pretty old traditional buildings then look at this ugly modern building"

### Best Modern
Some modern architecture which I've got to admit is not the worst ;).

The Gurkin, City of London
* It's a landmark and people like it, hard to argue with that.
* I do think the base is a bit bare and farr less pleasant than the lovely Leadenhall Market nearby.

Millenium Bride

London Eye

The Walkie Talkie

### The State of Architecture
Rough:
* Architecture schools
    * No longer teach key elements of traditional architecture
    * It's hard to find traditional architects
* Most firms struggle to do traditional designs
    * They're unfamiliar with the classical orders and botch them
    * They therefore promote modern designs
    * Some generalise botched examples to derogate traditionalism as "pastiche"  
    * Examples
      * 15 Finsbury Circus, London
      * 22-25 Finsbury Square, London
* Public Preference
    * Often doesn't have enough say
    * I think the public likes traditional architecture more than most architects do
* Cost Reduction
    * Sometimes cost and profit pressures sacrifice long-term builds for short term savings
    * Think: Flat Roofs, Falling Pannelling, Absence of Ornamentation, Streaky Stains as a building ages
* Industrial Production
    * Has turned buildings from a craft into an assembly
    * Is related to why *Modernism* rejects ornamentation
    * Explains WWI/WWII as a watershed moment for architecture
